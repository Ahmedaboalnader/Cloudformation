##  Project Overview
This project automates the deployment of a **complete 3-tier infrastructure** using **AWS CloudFormation**.  
The stack is designed for scalability, high availability, and automation.

### Components
- **VPC** with public and private subnets  
- **Security Groups** for secure network isolation  
- **Bastion Host** for SSH access to private instances  
- **Application & Web Load Balancers**  
- **Launch Templates** with Docker setup  
- **Auto Scaling Groups** for dynamic scaling  
- **RDS Database** in private subnets  
- **Docker containers** automatically launched on EC2 instances  

---

##  How It Works
1. **Database Stack** – Creates the RDS instance inside private subnets.  
2. **Compute Stack** –  
   - Deploys a Bastion Host in the public subnet.  
   - Creates Application and Web Load Balancers.  
   - Launches EC2 instances with Docker pre-installed.  
   - Links instances to Target Groups and Auto Scaling Groups.  
3. **Root Stack** – Integrates both stacks to form a complete infrastructure setup.
